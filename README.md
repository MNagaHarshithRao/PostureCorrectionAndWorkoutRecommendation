# 🧘‍♂️ Posture Correction and Workout Plan Generator

This project is focused on detecting human posture, identifying postural imbalances, and generating a customized workout plan to improve posture. Using pose estimation via MoveNet, trained heavily on the COCOPose dataset, our system can assess posture from images or live video and recommend corrective exercises accordingly.

📌 Features
📷 Posture Detection: Uses MoveNet to analyze 2D skeletal keypoints from images or video frames.

🧍 Posture Classification: Detects common postural deviations like forward head, rounded shoulders, anterior pelvic tilt, etc.

🏋️ Workout Plan Generation: Suggests personalized exercises based on detected issues.

📊 Progress Tracking (Optional): Logs posture improvements over time with visual keypoint comparison.

🧠 Model and Dataset
Pose Estimation Model: MoveNet
A fast and accurate model for human pose estimation.

Supports both SinglePose (for one person) and MultiPose variants.

Dataset: COCOPose
A curated version of the COCO dataset focused on keypoint annotations.

Contains over 100k labeled images of human poses.

MoveNet was fine-tuned on COCOPose for superior skeletal landmark accuracy.
